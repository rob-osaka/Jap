# Ingredients


Ready-made Dried Koji (Urikoji): This koji is prepared by drying fresh koji on large screens in an oven at 104°F. Both ready-made rice and barley koji are now available in the West at most natural food stores and at Japanese food markets (especially at New Years). The main U.S. producer is Miyako Oriental Foods in Los Angeles. In 1983 a 20-ounce tub of their white rice koji retailed for $3.46, or the equivalent of $2.77 a pound. Names of other makers, importers, and distributors are given on page 258. There are two basic types of ready-made dried koji:
Firm Granular Koji is composed of whole separate kernels of rice or barley with very little downy white mycelium visible on the surface of each grain. The beige or milky-white kernels look something like slightly puffed rice. One variety used primarily for making miso and one for salt-pickled vegetables (tsukemono). Miyako makes the miso type.
Soft Mat Koji is sold in sheets about 8 to 10 inches square and 3/4 inch thick. It is composed of fluffy grains of steamed rice bound together by a felt-like white mycelium resembling the nap on a brand new tennis ball. This koji is used primarily to prepare homemade Amazaké (p. 162) but also works well in the preparation of both miso and salt-pickled vegetables.

Firm granular koji is the traditional form used to make miso and is still considered the best since it has more "strength" (ability to break down proteins and carbohydrates) than the soft mat variety. High-quality granular koji will have a very small percentage of "transparent" grains (those which the mycelium has not penetrated) among the milky-white majority. Individual grains, when broken in half, should show the white mycelium penetrating to the very center and not have a transparent core.
Since dried koji does not, in general, have quite as much "strength" as fresh koji, miso prepared with it takes slightly longer to come to maturity. This explains the difference in aging times between the following homemade varieties and their commercial counterparts as described in Chapter 4.
All koji should be kept well sealed in a cool dry place. For long-term storage, small quantities should be refrigerated (but not frozen). Koji with an olive-green or yellowish tint has probably stood too long in a warm place causing sporulation; it is best used whole or ground as koji starter (p. 178).
Ready-made Fresh Koji: Excellent quality fresh rice koji, produced by Miyako Oriental Foods in Los Angeles, is now widely available in the U.S. In Japan, fresh koji may be purchased directly from a koji or miso shop the day before the soybeans are cooked; it is immediately crumbled and mixed with all of the salt in the miso recipe, placed in a covered container, and stored in a cool, dry place. A given volume of fresh koji weighs about 14 percent more than dried granular koji. In the following recipes, when substituting fresh koji for dried, use only 60 percent of the required mixing liquid.
Salt: Any salt may be used, but to make miso with the best flavor and nutritional value, use sun-dried, unrefined natural sea salt, now available at some natural and health food stores and very rich in minerals (more than 63 varieties). You can prepare your own natural salt by simmering clean sea water in a large kettle until almost all of the moisture has evaporated, placing the moist salt in a cloth-lined colander or strainer, and allowing it to drain for several days; measure homemade salt by volume rather than weight when using it to make miso. (Save the liquid nigari that drips from the salt to use in preparing tofu.)
The salt in miso mellows as the fermentation proceeds; thus miso which tastes quite salty after six months may taste just right one year later. To compensate for this phenomenon, some recipes increase the proportion of salt together with the expected fermentation time. Whereas a 1-year red miso might, for example, require 2 1/2 pounds of salt, the same product fermented for 2 1/2 years would require 4 pounds.
People wishing to prepare low-salt misos should make either sweet red or sweet white varieties; do not simply try to reduce the salt in other types or they may spoil. As a general rule, the minimum amount of salt used with a given weight of grain or dried koji should not fall below the broken line in figure 30. The equation for this minimum amount is:
S=45−G10 S = \frac{45 - G}{10}S=1045−G​
where SSS is the weight in pounds of salt and GGG is the weight in pounds of grain or dried koji used with 10 pounds of dry soybeans. Thus a recipe calling for 10 pounds each soybeans and dried rice koji should not contain less than 3.5 pounds salt.

Water: Any water may be used for cooking the soybeans or as mixing liquid (below), but fresh pure water—from a deep well, spring, or distilled—has traditionally been considered to give the best flavor and most trouble-free fermentation. Water containing an abundance of chlorine or other chemicals may somewhat retard the activity of miso's microorganisms, while impure water may introduce contaminating microorganisms.
Seed Miso: Use any good-quality mature miso, either from a previous batch of your own making or commercial miso which has not been pasteurized and contains no preservatives. The use of a small amount of seed miso as an inoculum adds large numbers of yeasts and bacteria to the unfermented ingredients thereby enhancing the aroma and flavor of the finished product and reducing the fermentation time by up to 50 percent. It is best to use seed miso of the same variety as the miso you wish to prepare, but any miso will work.
Mixing Liquid: Either boiled water or the cooking liquid remaining after boiling the soybeans is mixed with the other ingredients to give the miso its proper moisture content. In Japan, this is called "seed water" (tané mizu). Fresh water, unless taken from a very pure deep well, is always boiled to assure that no contaminating microorganisms are present. From November until early April, soybean cooking liquid gives excellent results and helps make full use of the soybean nutrients. However, if the miso is prepared during the warm half of the year, water should be used since the soybean cooking liquid may encourage spoilage; in this case, cook the soybeans so that very little liquid remains at the end. If you want to try to use cooking liquid during the warmer part of the year, mix the liquid with 3 tablespoons salt as soon as it has drained from the beans, and reduce the salt added with the other ingredients accordingly.
The proper amount of liquid to be added to any given mixture of ingredients is difficult to specify exactly since it depends upon the moisture level of the koji and the moisture losses through the vat (which are determined by the vat's size and construction). If too much liquid is added, the miso can easily over-ferment and develop a strong alcoholic aroma. The miso's moisture content can be adjusted during fermentation by simply increasing or decreasing the pressing weight.
Alternate Carbohydrate Sources: For rice or barley koji, you may substitute up to 50 percent cornmeal or corn, sweet potatoes, Irish potatoes, or kabocha; these foods should be well steamed or boiled (see Variation 5). Wheat koji may be substituted in equal parts. See also page 44.
Alternate Protein Sources: For soybeans, you may substitute up to 100 percent broad, black, azuki, lima, or garbanzo beans, or others listed on page 44. Indian pulses (Bengal gram, Thur dhal, green gram, and Field beans) also work well. If 10 to 20 percent soybeans (and peanuts) are used together with these ingredients, the amino acid balance and total usable protein will be considerably enhanced.

Notes:

The ready-made firm granular dried koji produced in the U.S. by Miyako Oriental Foods weighs 175 grams (6.17 ounces) per cup, or 36 percent more per cup than the figures given in this table. Since the basic proportions of the table are based on weight, use either the same weight as shown in the table or 66 percent the required volume. Example: to make a small batch of red miso using Miyako firm granular dried koji, use either 11.1 ounces or 1.58 cups of this koji.
If using fresh koji, use 1.14 times as much by weight as the dried koji.
If using fresh koji, use only 40 to 60 percent as much mixing liquid; for firm granular koji, only 80 to 90 percent as much.

## Homemade Red Miso

MAKES 6 CUPS OR 3.6 POUNDS (Sendai Miso)
Basic proportions by weight: soybeans 10, dried rice koji 8.5, salt 4.4, mixing liquid 11.1 (reduced to 6.7 if using fresh koji), seed miso 0.4.

2 cups (13 ounces) whole dry soybeans
3 1/4 cups water
9 tablespoons (5.7 ounces) natural salt
1 tablespoon seed miso (optional)
1 1/2 cups mixing liquid
11.1 ounces (315 grams) ready-made dried rice koji (about 3.4 cups well-crumbled soft mat koji or 2.4 cups homemade or firm granular koji)

PREPARE IN ADVANCE

Carefully remove any split soybeans (their loose hulls easily clog pressure cooker), then wash beans thoroughly in pressure cooker. Add 3 1/4 cups water, cover pot, and soak for 3 hours, or until beans have swelled to fill hulls tightly. Skim off any hulls floating in water.
To cook beans without pressure, see Variation 1.
If using a wooden vat, fill it with water and allow it to stand overnight to seal leaks.


Bring cooker to full pressure over medium-high heat. When steam first begins to jiggle vent cap, turn heat immediately to very low (to prevent foaming over); cook for 25 minutes at 15 pounds (30 minutes at 10 pounds, or 75 minutes at 5 pounds). Remove from heat and allow to stand for 10 to 15 minutes as pressure returns to normal. Open cooker and test for doneness; each bean should be soft enough to be easily crushed between your thumb and ring finger. Re-cover cooker.


See that all utensils are well washed, preferably doused with boiling water. Place colander over (or into) mixing pot, pour in cooked beans, and allow to drain for 3 to 5 minutes before returning beans to cooker. Using pestle or potato masher, mash beans until only about one-third remain whole. Or run two-thirds of the beans through a grain mill or meat grinder. (For smooth miso, mash or grind all beans.) Allow beans' temperature to cool to 110°F.


Remove cooking liquid from mixing pot and measure out 1 1/4 cups, reserving any excess for use in other cooking; if insufficient liquid remains, add the necessary amount of boiled water. Combine in the mixing pot all but 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt and, if used, the seed miso. Add 1/4 cup liquid, mixing with a wooden spoon until smooth, then stir in the remaining 1 1/2 cups liquid. Wash hands. Using fingertips, crumble koji into mixing pot, then stir into liquid mixture. Now add soybeans and mix all ingredients thoroughly, using first the wooden spoon, then your hands to squeeze the ingredients together. After mixing, ingredients should have about the same consistency as mature miso.


Wash, rinse, and dry vat. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon salt onto your moistened fingertips and rub salt over walls of vat. Sprinkle additional 1/4 teaspoon salt over bottom of vat, then spoon in miso mixture, packing it down firmly to expel air pockets. Smooth miso surface, then sprinkle on and gently rub in the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Cover surface with sealing sheet, pressing it firmly against miso to expel surface air bubbles. Top with pressing lid and weight(s).


Within several days, make additional batches of mixed ingredients as described above; rub salt over vat's walls before packing in mixture but do not sprinkle additional salt over surface of previous batch. When vat is at least 80 percent full and contains a minimum of 12 cups unfermented miso, sprinkle surface with salt and top with sealing sheet, lid, and weight(s).


Cover container with a double layer of wrapping paper and tie in place with string. On index card, write type of miso prepared, exact ingredients used, the date, and date at which miso is expected to be ready. Make a note of this latter date on your yearly calendar and tape index card to paper-wrapped vat.


For natural fermentation, choose an unheated environment such as a garage, storeroom, workshop, or barn for faster (temperature-controlled) fermentation, see Variation 2. Choose a location that receives no direct sunlight and has adequate air circulation. Clean area well and set vat off floor on several blocks. Allow miso to ferment for at least 6 months including 1 full summer. The finest flavor will be attained after 12 months (or 18 to 24 months if seed miso is not used). Do not stir miso during fermentation.


As fermentation proceeds, you may wish to check the miso once every few months. However, do not open the vat more than is necessary since contact with the air encourages the growth of surface mold and contaminating organisms, and causes a slight darkening of the color and loss of aroma. If, after one month, no liquid tamari has risen to the miso's surface, increase the pressing weight. If tamari rises to a depth of more than 1/2 inch during the warm months, reduce the weight. To taste the miso, remove lid and sealing sheet and tilt vat so that tamari runs to one side. Using a clean spoon, open a small hole 3 to 4 inches deep at center of miso surface and retrieve a sample. Compare aroma, flavor, color, and texture with your favorite commercial miso and record your impressions on index card. If flavor is too salty or color too light, increase fermentation time. If texture is too soft, increase pressing weight and remove tamari for use in cookery (pp. 50 or 77). Overly alcoholic, acidic, or sour flavors cannot be remedied and may require that the miso be discarded. After each tasting, record date for next tasting on yearly calendar.


When miso is mature, remove all covering; carefully scrape off and discard any surface mold. (Although this mold is not harmful, it causes a slight decline in the miso aroma and flavor). Mix miso in container thoroughly from top to bottom to evenly distribute tamari and saltier surface layer. (Removal of tamari for use in cookery will cause a slight decline in the miso flavor.) Spoon a 1-month supply of miso into a small crock or jar and place in a refrigerator or other cool place for daily use. Smooth surface of miso remaining in container, re-cover, and weight as before. All non-sweet miso may be stored in its vat for 1 to 3 years; sweet miso should be stored in a very cool place and used within 1 to 2 months.


### VARIATIONS


Cooking Soybeans Without Pressure: Wash beans thoroughly in cooking pot and drain well. Add 8 cups water, cover, and allow to stand for 12 to 14 hours at room temperature. (At temperatures below 50°F, increase soaking time to 18 hours.) Bring covered beans to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to very low, set lid ajar, and simmer for about 2 hours, skimming off any foam and hulls that surface. Add 3 cups (hot) water and simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours more, or until beans are soft (see Step 1). If necessary, add water from time to time so that about 2 cups cooking liquid remain when beans are done. Drain and proceed from Step 2.


Temperature-controlled Fermentation: Place the vat of mixed, unfermented ingredients in a warm dark place such as a water heater- or furnace room, above a stove, or in an insulated attic. During the first 2 months, choose a location where the temperature is 70°F to 75°F. Then transfer for 2 months to a temperature of about 85°F. Finally, return to the original temperature for 2 months more. Allow the miso to stand in an unheated environment for 1 week before opening (fig. 49, p. 236). (For an even faster fermentation, place at 85°F for 1 week, 90°F for 2 to 3 months, 85°F for 1 week more, then ripen for 1 week in an unheated place.) Flavor will be improved if the miso is stirred thoroughly once or twice during this period. Fermentation time can also be decreased by packing mixed ingredients into vat while they are still hot (90°F to 100°F) and wrapping vat with several layers of thick toweling.


Using Fresh Koji: Substitute for the 11.1 ounces ready-made dried koji, 12.7 ounces fresh koji. Purchase or prepare this koji before starting to cook the soybeans, as explained on page 177. Use only 1 cup mixing liquid.


Using Soy Grits: The use of grits reduces the soaking, cooking, and fermentation times, and yields a lighter colored miso. Substitute as equal weight of grits for the soybeans in the basic recipe. a) To Pressure Cook: Soak as for whole soybeans, then pressure cook for 12 minutes. Continue as for the basic recipe. b) To Boil: Combine grits and 5 cups water in a large pot, cover, and soak for 2 1/2 hours. Bring to a boil over low heat and simmer for 1 hour with lid slightly ajar.


Using Alternate Protein and Carbohydrate Sources: Lists of these are given on pages 44 and 171. All or part of the soybeans may be replaced by other beans. Soak, cook, and add these to the miso as for soybeans. If using alternate carbohydrate sources, add no more than 5 1/2 ounces cooked weight and reduce the weight of koji by one half the weight of the carbohydrates added; mash well before mixing with koji. For example, to prepare a small batch of Sweet Potato Miso: Combine 5 1/2 ounces each dried koji and mashed cooked sweet potatoes. Mix in the salt, cooked (mashed) soybeans, seed miso, and 1 cup mixing liquid (two-thirds the basic amount). Ferment as for red miso.


Alternate Basic Ratios: There are many different varieties of red miso, each determined by its ratio of basic ingredient weights. The ratio used by the Sendai Miso-shoyu Co., which makes most of the 1-year natural red miso sold in the West, is soybeans 10, koji 5.8, salt 4.5. Mr. Junsei Yamazaki (p. 241) uses 10:10:2.5 for 1-year red miso, increasing the salt to 3.5 for 2-year miso. Mr. Herman Aihara uses 10:10:3.0 for 8-month miso. Other ratios commonly employed in Japan are: a) soybeans 10, koji 6.4, salt 5.3; b) soybeans 10, koji 5.0, salt 4.1; c) soybeans 10, koji 7.2, salt 4.9. Notice that in the latter proportions, the salt is considerably higher than that used in America.


## Homemade Barley Miso (Mugi Miso)

For basic ratios and amounts of raw materials, see page 172. Prepare as for Homemade Red Miso except: 1) Use barley koji instead of rice koji. 2) Increase the amount of water used in cooking the beans so that the necessary amount of mixing liquid remains when the beans have finished cooking. 3) Using natural fermentation, allow miso to ferment for at least 12 to 18 months; the finest flavor will be attained after 2 to 3 years. If using temperature-controlled fermentation, reduce the above fermentation time by one half. 4) Virtually all barley miso calls for 10 parts each by weight of dry soybeans and dry koji. The ratio of salt used in America is as low as 3.5; in Japan it ranges from 4.6 to 6.0, with the latter proportion requiring 2 to 3 years fermentation.
Homemade Light-yellow Miso (Shinshu Miso)
For the basic ratio of raw materials, see page 172. Prepare as for Homemade Red Miso except: 1) After soaking, drain the beans, measure the amount of water drained, and add back an equal amount of fresh water. 2) For a lighter colored miso, rub the soaked beans between the palms of both hands to remove seed coats before cooking. 3) Pressure cook beans to give a light color. 4) For an even lighter color (accompanied, however, by a loss of nutrients) discard all soybean cooking liquid and use boiled water as the mixing liquid. 5) Using natural fermentation, age for the same time as red miso. Using temperature-controlled fermentation (to give a still lighter color) ferment for 1 week at 86°F, 3 weeks at 95°F, 1 more week at 86°F, and then allow to stand at room temperature for 1 week before serving. 6) For a slightly saltier miso, increase the ratio of salt from 4.1 to 4.5 and increase the aging time by 10 percent.

Homemade Sweet Red Miso (Edo Miso)

This is an excellent variety for those who don't want to wait more than one month to sample their homemade miso. Prepare as for Homemade Red Miso except: 1) Boil the soybeans for 8 to 10 hours, adding water as required. Or boil for 4 hours, allow to stand covered overnight, and return to the boil the next morning. Both procedures give the beans a deep reddish-brown color. 2) Drain beans for no more than 1 minute to prevent them from cooling. 3) Mash no more than 50 percent of the whole beans. 4) Mix beans with koji while beans are still quite hot (140°F to 158°F). Do not use seed miso lest the final miso sour slightly. 5) Pack the mixture into vat while mixture is still quite warm (122°F to 131°F). 6) Wrap vat with heavy towels to minimize heat loss, cover, and press as in the basic recipe. Place in a very warm environment (104°F to 113°F) for 3 weeks, then unwrap container and allow miso to ripen at room temperature for one week before serving. (Or wrap and ferment naturally for 4 to 5 weeks). Refrigerate the remaining miso to prevent spoilage.

Homemade Sweet White Miso (Shiro Miso)

Due to its high carbohydrate and low salt content, this miso takes less time to ferment than any other variety and is therefore excellent for homemade miso experimentation. Wash and cook soybeans as for Homemade Light-yellow Miso. Pack into vat while beans are quite warm and wrap as for Sweet Red Miso (above). Proceed as for light-yellow miso except: 1) Reduce fermentation time as follows: If using natural fermentation, age for 1 to 3 weeks in summer (taste frequently), 5 weeks in spring or fall, and 6 to 8 weeks in winter. If using temperature-controlled fermentation, age at 95°F for 1 to 3 weeks, or 113°F for 1 to 2 weeks. Commercial makers say this miso can be prepared in 24 hours if the basic ratio by weight is soybeans 10, dried koji 20, and salt 1.5, and if the temperature of the room is 140°F. Before serving, grind the miso in a grain mill or meat grinder to create a smooth texture.
Some makers suggest increasing the basic proportion of koji from 20 to 24 if dried rather than fresh koji is used, and increasing the proportion to 30 if the miso is prepared during the winter by natural fermentation. When using temperature-controlled fermentation, many makers mix the miso once midway through the fermentation.

Homemade Mellow Barley Miso (Amakuchi Mugi Miso)

For the basic ratios of raw materials, see page 172. Prepare as for Homemade Red Miso except: 1) Use barley koji instead of rice koji. 2) Add enough water to the beans so that the necessary amount of mixing liquid remains when the beans have finished cooking. 3) Ferment the miso for the same lengths of time and at the same temperatures as for Homemade Sweet White Miso.

Homemade Hishio

MAKES 4 1/2 CUPS

Also called Namé-mono or o-namé, hishio is a variety of country-style namémiso requiring a relatively short fermentation. It is generally prepared in farmhouses sometime between October and May. The koji is prepared both with and without soybeans depending on the locality. The method using soybeans is more difficult since, if the temperature rises, natto bacteria often propagate and the miso fails. In some localities, instead of stirring the miso daily, a pressing lid is used and the miso is left untouched. Hishio is thought to be the earliest ancestor of present-day shoyu.

4 ounces eggplant, well washed
5 ounces cucumber or uri melon, well washed
8 tablespoons salt
3 cups (13.4 ounces) ready-made dried wheat or barley koji
2 1/4 cups boiled water
2 ounces gingerroot, parboiled, and thinly sliced (optional)

Parboil eggplant and cucumber for about 1 minute to sterilize, then cool briefly and dice. Combine in a small bowl with 1 tablespoon salt, and gently rub salt into vegetables. Set a plate atop the layer of vegetables in bowl and place a 4- to 5-pound weight atop plate. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and press for 1 week.
On the same day vegetables begin to press, combine the koji, water, remaining 7 tablespoons salt and, if used, the gingerroot in the fermentation container. Cover container with a sheet of paper or plastic wrap held in place by a string, and place container in a clean location which receives no direct sunlight. Stir the mixture thoroughly once daily.
After 1 week, pour off all liquid from the pressed vegetables and discard. Wash hands, then squeeze vegetables firmly to expel any excess liquid. Mix vegetables into fermenting hishio. Allow hishio to ferment for 3 more weeks, stirring daily. The finished product should have a very moist texture (similar to applesauce) and pleasant, subtly sweet fragrance and flavor. Store covered in a cool place or refrigerator to prevent further fermentation.
To prepare the same miso using soybeans, use 3 1/3 cups rice koji, 1 cup soybeans and 1/3 cup salt, plus other ingredients as listed above. Cook beans, cool to body temperature and mash, then mix with the koji and cooking liquid. Add remaining ingredients and transfer to a crock. Allow to ferment, mixing daily, for about 1 to 2 weeks.

Indian Pulse & Soybean Miso

Developed in 1963 by Dr. T. N. Rao of the Central Food Technological Research Institute in Mysore, India, this flavorful product is a good example of how Japanese miso can be adapted to the tastes and ingredients of other countries. The use of a relatively small proportion of soybeans and peanuts together with local pulses greatly enhances the amino acid balance; the resultant product contains 11.2 percent protein when Bengal gram is used and 8.7 percent with Thur dhal. The percentages of salt are 5.0 and 5.4 respectively. To give a longer shelf life, powdered red peppers or chilies may be added to taste.

2 1/2 pounds dehulled Bengal gram or Thur dhal, soaked for 15 hours in water to cover
1/2 pound whole dry soybeans, soaked for 12 hours
3/4 pound chopped peanuts
2 1/2 pounds rice koji
3/4 pound salt

Pressure-cook pulses like soybeans (25 minutes at 15 pounds), then drain and reserve. Combine soybeans and peanuts, and pressure cook as in the basic method above. Mix cooked ingredients with koji and salt (and spices if desired), add enough cooking liquid to give the desired consistency (45 to 47 percent moisture), and pack into vat. Ferment at 83°F for 5 to 10 days. Store in a very cool place, or refrigerate.
