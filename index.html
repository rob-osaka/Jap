                    <h2 id="what-is-hatcho-miso">What is Hatcho Miso?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hatcho Miso is famous for the same reason that Okazaki
                        is famous: Tokugawa Ieyasu, stone products, and
                        fireworks. Hatcho Miso has a unique flavour which is
                        made from high-quality soybeans, salt and water. Cooked
                        and mashed soybeans are shaped into small balls and
                        mixed with salty water. Then the Miso ferments for 3
                        winters. Hatcho Miso is made by the Hatcho Miso Company
                        in Hatcho (Eighth street), to the west of Okazaki
                        castle. The name Hatcho is taken from this location. In
                        the Meiji era, Hatcho Miso became the daily choice of
                        the Emperor of Japan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hatcho Miso is less in water and salt content. It is
                        easy to digest due to the aminolysis of the soy protein
                        and is high in vitamins and minerals. Hatcho Miso is a
                        natural food since neither food additives nor
                        pasteurisation is used. Miso has yeast fungi which need
                        carbohydrates, the right temperature and enzymes. Summer
                        in the Tokai area(the middle part of Japan) is hot and
                        the hot weather accelerates yeast fungi fermentation
                        very quickly in kome (rice)-miso or mugi (barley)-miso.
                        Thus Hatcho Miso developed mame (beans)-miso which
                        contains less carbohydrates and tolerates the hot
                        weather much better. Hatcho Miso was Tokugawa Ieyasu's
                        favourite and his armies were supplied with the miso
                        because it can be stored for quite a while and can be
                        portable due to its reduced water content. It also has
                        been taken on Japanese expeditions to the South Pole.

                    <p>
                        Hatcho is the place where Hatcho Miso originated and it
                        is "hatcho= eight cho"(cho is an old unit of length used
                        in Japan to measure distance: one cho is equal to 108
                        metres) away from Okazaki castle where Tokugawa Ieyasu,
                        who founded the Edo feudal government, lived. The Hatcho
                        is located on the banks of the Yahagi River, as it was
                        easy to transport soybeans and sea salt there. Also
                        Hatcho is the best place where high-quality springwater
                        is easily accessible from the granitoid ground in
                        Okazaki and is endowed with the right temperature and
                        suitable humidity in order to make Hatcho Miso. Yahagi
                        soybeans or Nanbu soybeans (Touhoku) and Aiba salt (Kira
                        at the mouth of Yahagi River) were mainly used back
                        then, however currently the ingredients are from all
                        over the nation such as soybeans from Hokkaido and sea
                        salt from Okinawa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Salt, lumber for miso vats (considered to be Yoshino
                        cedar) and river stones for piling on miso were
                        transported by ship. Half a shipful of salt was unloaded
                        at this place and the rest was carried to Asuke at the
                        upper reaches of the Yahagi River. The salt was
                        transported on foot or by horse from there to Shiojiri
                        along a road called "shio no michi (The road of salt)".
                        Then the empty ship was loaded with a lot of river
                        stones and brought them back to Hatcho. Thus the river
                        stones used currently are from Asuke. It was paid for by
                        miso as a replacement for money and the ship owner left
                        acertain amount of miso for himself and sold the rest in
                        Osaka or Edo.

                    <p>
                        We come back to the Hatcho Miso. Savory Hatcho Miso was
                        well appreciated by Tokugawa's armies due to its
                        mobility and long storage resulted from less salt
                        content. Hatcho Miso spread throughout Edo (now Tokyo)
                        as Tokugawa moved the capital to Edo. It also spread
                        throughout the country due to feudal lords' Mandatory
                        Alternate Residence System in Edo. Nevertheless Hatcho
                        Miso currently holds only a10% share whereas kome-miso
                        (rice miso) takes about 80%. The first biggest damage to
                        Hatcho Miso was because of the Tokyo Earthquake in 1923.
                        White kome-miso was brought from Nagano prefecture in
                        relief supplies to help out victims. Furthermore, the
                        Second World War made Hatcho Miso almost completely
                        disappear by bringing kome-miso into the Kanto area as
                        relief supplies. Although Hatcho Miso disappeared, it
                        got the right to supply the Japanese royal family in
                        1892 and became the daily choice of the Emperor. Even
                        though the system was abolished in 1954, Hatcho Miso is
                        still the Emperor's favorite miso.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hatcho Miso spreads not just domestically but also
                        internationally and is exported to 33 countries in the
                        world. Hatcho Miso has less water content which makes it
                        harder to go off, therefore tolerates lengthy
                        transportation. Some countries have their own
                        regulations on the ingredients hence it is necessary to
                        make Hatcho Miso (including package) separately from the
                        ones for domestic market. However along with the
                        domestic market, white miso takes the majority and
                        Hatcho Miso is not as popular as white miso yet.

                    <p>
                        Everything was done by hand a long time ago. A hot-water
                        kettle was used to generate steam for soy beans at that
                        time. The kettles used by one of the Hatcho Miso
                        companies were made by Hattori Kougyo K.K.(established
                        in 1885). Some of the kettles have 1 or 2 holes of about
                        10 centimetres in diameter, called "yukuchi" or
                        "yuguchi". Sake breweries and miso makers have steaming
                        processes using a big kettle and a steamer,"seiro". A
                        set of kettle and steamer is called "koshiki" (cupola
                        furnace). Once a steamer is set on top of a big kettle,
                        it is necessary to supply additional water without
                        moving the steamer during the steaming process. The
                        holes are specially designed for that reason. One hole
                        is common but 2 holes are extremely rare. These holes
                        are drilled after casting the kettle. Soy beans are
                        steamed in the cupola furnance and shaped into
                        fist-sized balls to be dusted with koji mould spores.
                        The balls are then mixed with salty water in a basin
                        called "hangiri".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then the miso is carried into a big cedar vat and beaten
                        out. The depth and diameter of the vat are six "shaku"
                        (shaku is a unit of length: one shaku is equal to about
                        30.3 centimetres). The staves are more than 10
                        centimetres thick. After putting 6 tonnes of miso in a
                        vat, cover the top with a linen cloth and 15-20 of thin
                        and long wooden boards are to be placed as a lid. On top
                        of the wooden lid, pile on top a 3-tonne-pyramid of
                        river stones. The stones weigh half of the miso and the
                        vat is ready to be left for 3 years without moving the
                        stones. The salt content in miso can be reduced by
                        pressing. The masonry is the only process still done by
                        hand. The pyramid like river stones are not merely piled
                        up randomly. It is carefully-calculated not to collapse.
                        The stones are piled up by making the outside higher and
                        putting pressure on the centre. This structure operates
                        similar to stone walls of old Japanese castles and can
                        withstand earthquakes with a seismic intensity of 3 or
                        4. It requires 10 years of experience to pile up stones
                        in a good shape. The stones used to be carried one at a
                        time by hand throught a few people on a ladder though
                        the stones are moved by forklift and piled up by 3-4
                        people in 30 minutes to 1 hour. Each of about the 150
                        stones weighs a maximum of 20 kilograms to be carried by
                        one person. The reason why one big stone of 3 tonnes
                        cannot be used is because there would be deviations to
                        one side or the other. Theoretically water is an
                        alternative but it is also a natural enemy of miso hence
                        this cannot happen.

                        Hatcho Miso can be made easily without quality
                        management except for worrying about leaking roofs.
                        Hatcho Miso is called ten nen jozo (naturally fermented
                        food) because it is made in the course of nature.
                        Mechanical methods which make miso ferment artificially
                        has spread largely due to cutting-costs, however it has
                        a plain flavour compared to naturally fermented miso.
                        The old traditions have been maintained to make Hatcho
                        Miso. Hatcho Miso ferments as much as the river stones
                        are lifted a little bit as a result of summer heat and
                        lowered by wintry chill. Hatcho Miso needs both summer
                        and winter. The taste and flavour could be changed a
                        little bit by a cold summer and a warm winter but the
                        changes cannot be tasted by human beings. In recent
                        years miso vats have been pedestaled to be moved by
                        forklift. Until forklifts were introduced, vats were
                        placed on the floor therefore the production process was
                        carried on with a focus on the vats of more than 6
                        tonnes. Now a new process is carried on that focuses on
                        miso.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nowadays almost all of the production process is done by
                        machine though the miso vats used currently are about
                        100 years old. For your information, the container for
                        miso is called oke (vat) not taru (cask). Oke is used as
                        a container which has no lid and can get a lid on. On
                        the other hand taru is a container with a lid. Beer keg
                        has a lid and is called taru and bathtub does not have a
                        lid, which is called furo (bath) -oke. There are some
                        small casks for miso called kesho daru in the market
                        because the cask is made as a package of miso. At the
                        back of the miso vat, there are some letters which
                        indicate the name of person(s) who made it and the year
                        it was made. There are some reasons why the 100-year-old
                        vats are still used. The first one is due to the live
                        microorganism called Aspergillus. This microorganism
                        lives over centuries and creates a unique Hatcho Miso
                        flavour. Vats are not washed until the next time miso is
                        carried into it. If the vats are washed right after,
                        they immediately dry and become loose. Thus miso sits a
                        little bit on the surface of used vats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another reason is the shortage of vats. About 50-60 vats
                        are made at one time. The newest vats were made in
                        Taisho Period. This resulted from the aging of oke and
                        taga (hoops of braided bamboo around oke) makers. These
                        makers are very old and they do not have the physical
                        strength to make such a huge oke and taga. At one of the
                        Hatcho Miso companies, these makers have become the
                        company staff these days. To make matters worse,
                        Japanese cedar used as lumber for the miso vats has
                        decresed. Japanese cedar or Japanese cypress are the
                        most suitable lumber for miso vats but cedar is mainly
                        used since Japanese cypress is more valuable and harder
                        to manufacture. Alternative materials such as stainless
                        steel or FRP (Fibre Reinforced Plastic) are under
                        investigation. However there are concerns about changes
                        of flavour between cedar vats and stainless steel or FRP
                        vats. Another choice is to buy used vats from Japanese
                        sake brewing at cheaper prices since they use similar
                        vats. On the other hand, taga is a braided bamboo hoop
                        and used to bind cedar staves together. Hoops are made
                        from bamboo and these hoops become loose as time goes
                        on. Such loose hoops can be replaced by iron ones. The
                        irons hoops look red as a result of anticorrosive paint.
                        The iron ones act the same as bamboo ones.

                        It is said that miso was brought from China or the
                        Korean Peninsula, however it is also said that Japan's
                        warm and humid weather created the existing miso at the
                        time. Although miso-like food was found from remains
                        from the Jomon Period, the early authentic literature on
                        miso was released during the Heian Period. This may be
                        because miso was food for the populace and such food
                        hardly became a topic of literature at that time. People
                        had eaten soybeans as seasoning or sources of protein
                        before the Muromachi Period when Miso-shiru (Miso soup)
                        was formed. The Kamakura Period saw miso being grated
                        and miso dishes were created.

                        Miso can be classified by colour and ingredients. There
                        would be 2 types by colour: aka (red)-miso and shiro
                        (white)-miso. Some people divide it into 3 groups such
                        as aka (red)-miso, shiro (white)-miso and naka-miso
                        which means "blend". Soybeans for aka-miso are steamed
                        and beans for shiro-miso were originally boiled but some
                        of them are also steamed. Steamed beans are more
                        nutritious than boiled ones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another classification is made by ingredients; mame
                        (bean)-miso, kome (rice)-miso and mugi (barley)-miso.
                        Mame-miso has less carbohydrate than other types of
                        miso. Soybeans are used for all types of miso but Koji
                        mould spores are mixed with Aspergillus and the soybeans
                        for mame-miso, with Aspergillus and rice for kome-miso,
                        and with Aspergillus and barley for mugi-miso. Koji is a
                        type of fungus which secretes deigestive enzymes. The
                        aminolysis of soy protein and fat is largely due to the
                        Koji. When the ingredients are mixed with Koji, they are
                        called mame-koji for mame-miso, kome-koji for kome-miso
                        and mugi-koji for mugi-miso. Although the Koji mould
                        spores themselves disappear when they are mixed with
                        water and salt, the digestive enzymes are still alive
                        and the activity of the enzymes is the key point of miso
                        making. Kome-koji is high in salt content. Shinshu-miso
                        (kome-miso)contains 12-18% of salt whereas Hatcho Miso
                        holds 9-12% only.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        85% of miso sold throughout the country is kome-miso,
                        mame-miso such as Hatcho Miso is 12%, and mugi-miso is
                        only 3%. Hatcho Miso takes longer to mature than others,
                        contains high protein, has less water content, and is
                        concentrated. However at the same time it contains less
                        salt content and is highly nutririous. Hatcho Miso is
                        classified as mame-miso and mame-miso is usually red,
                        and kome-miso and mugi-miso are white. Even so some kome
                        such as "Sendai Miso" and mugi-miso are also red. The
                        period of fermentation depends on types. Mild shiro-miso
                        takes a week to mature, white kome-miso needs from 1 to
                        3 months, and red kome-miso needs 3 months to one year
                        though mame-miso ferments through 6 months to 2 years.
                        Some types of kome-miso take more than 7 years at low
                        temperatures.

                        The main element that decides the colour is "Maillard
                        Chemistry". This is a non-enzymatic browning reaction
                        and happens when sugar molecules and aminoacids are
                        heated together. This reaction occurs when soybeans are
                        soaked, boiled or steamed and continues during
                        fermentation. The degree of Maillard Chemistry depends
                        on ingredients and the method of production, but
                        generally the more the reaction happens, the more brown
                        miso becomes. Therefore, mame-miso is usually a dark
                        colour and needs longer time to ferment. Hatcho Miso
                        turns brownish as a result of steamed soybeans.

                    <p>
                        "Akadashi Hatcho Miso" is a combination of Hatcho Miso
                        and shiro-miso. It is soft and milder than Hatcho Miso
                        and its name came from the making process. It originated
                        from Hatcho Miso and Akadashi originally means
                        extracting red from Hatcho Miso. Grate Hatcho Miso and
                        put its soup in a tea towel to squeeze, then mix it with
                        shiro-miso (white one). To be brief, mix red miso with
                        white miso. The best proportion of white and red miso
                        for green vegetable miso soup is 8 to 2 and for
                        shellfish miso soup is 2 to 8. When 5% of Hatcho Miso is
                        mixed with white miso, it is called "Akazashi" and when
                        the proportion is 15%, it is "Akagachi". "Fukusa" is
                        used when Hatcho Miso and white miso are mixed
                        half-and-half.

                    <p>
                        "Tamari" is a fallout of Hatcho Miso. Tamari is the
                        liquid piled up on top of Hatcho Miso during
                        fermentation. It is preferred in the place where
                        mame-miso is eaten. There is a deep relationship between
                        miso and tamari. When it is focused on miso, tamari is
                        not skimmed because strained miso lees cannot be sold
                        and its tamari has less salt content and becomes
                        tasteless even though it is very rich. Thus tamari has a
                        different starting point from miso. Tamari has to be
                        made separately from miso and with a different
                        proportion of ingredients. Very black soy sauce like
                        tamari is purely made by soybeans and salt. Common soy
                        sauce is made also by barley, hence it has a lighter
                        colour. However, it turns brownish when it is not
                        preserved properly. The brown colour of miso and soy
                        sauce is made by a reaction of amylum and protein
                        substance. Weak soy sauce is much stronger than strong
                        soy sauce unlike its look.

                            Cancer prevention: Takeshi Hirayama of the National
                            Cancer Centre Research Institute in Japan in 1981
                            found that cancer could be prevented by miso.
                            According to his research, people who eat miso soup
                            daily are correlated with 50% lower stomach cancer
                            rates than people who do not eat miso soup at all.
                            He also clarified that the vegetables accompanying
                            miso soup also have cancer prevention effects. In
                            1992, Akihiro Ito from the Research Institute for
                            Radiation Biology and Medicine (Hiroshima
                            University) also revealed that miso has such effects
                            on mice. Male mice were divided into 2 groups and
                            received neutron radiation. One group of mice was
                            fed normal food as usual and 62% of them got liver
                            cancer although only 13% of another group, which had
                            10% of miso in their food, got liver cancer.

                            Detoxifying radioactive substance: In Hiroshima, the
                            aftermath of radiation was investigated by some
                            researchers and according to a report, some people
                            who had eaten miso suffered less from radiation
                            disease. Akihiro Ito at Hiroshima University
                            confirmed the effects by using mice. He divided mice
                            into 4 groups and fed normal food, food with 10% of
                            dried red miso, food with 10% of soy sause and food
                            with the same amount of salt as miso to the groups.
                            3 days later, the mice were examined for the
                            survival rates of their hepatocytes of small
                            inestinal mucous membrane. In the results, the rate
                            of the group which had miso was the highest and
                            moreover some of the damaged cells in the mice which
                            had miso or soy sause reproduced themselves. This is
                            known widely in Europe as well and miso was exported
                            in large amounts in the aftermath of the Chernobyl

                            Antiaging: Vitamin E, amino acids, saponin,
                            melanoidin, lipofuscin and so on in miso have
                            antioxidant punch. To remain young and maintain
                            health, it is important to get rid of active oxygen
                            that force substances in the body to be oxidised.
                            Hiromichi Katoh from Otsuma Women's University
                            disclosed how well miso controls active oxygen in
                            1995. According to his research, active oxygen was
                            greately controlled in both normal and low-sodium
                            miso but low-sodium miso had greater effects.
                            Low-sodium miso such as Hatcho Miso has a more
                            beneficial impact on health. Supporting the
                            research, Tokugawa Ieyasu lived to 75 years old when
                            the average life expectation was 37.8 years old. He
                            tried to maintain his health and had 5 different
                            types of leaf vegetables and 3 kinds of root
                            vegetables in miso soup everyday.

                            assimilated but it transforms itself through enzymes
                            and microorganisms in the fermentation process to be
                            assimilated easily. It also contains active
                            digestive enzymes, which help digestion of other.
