                        <p>Miso is a traditional Japanese fermented food made from soybeans, salt, and koji (a fermentation culture). It's a fundamental ingredient in Japanese cuisine, providing rich umami flavor to countless dishes beyond the well-known miso soup.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="ingredients" class="miso">
                        <h2>Basic Ingredients for Homemade Miso</h2>
                        
                        <h3>Soybeans</h3>
                        <p>Any variety of whole dry soybeans available at natural or health food stores, co-ops, and some supermarkets can be used. The larger sized and slightly more expensive "vegetable" type soybeans, bred from Japanese stock, are preferred by some to the smaller and more widely available U.S. "field" soybeans.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Koji</h3>
                        <p>Ready-made dried koji (Urikoji) is prepared by drying fresh koji on large screens in an oven at 104°F. Both ready-made rice and barley koji are available in natural food stores and Japanese food markets. There are two basic types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Firm Granular Koji</strong> - Composed of whole separate kernels of rice or barley with very little downy white mycelium visible on the surface of each grain. The beige or milky-white kernels look something like slightly puffed rice.</li>
                            <li><strong>Soft Mat Koji</strong> - Sold in sheets about 8 to 10 inches square and ¾ inch thick. It is composed of fluffy grains of steamed rice bound together by a felt-like white mycelium resembling the nap on a brand new tennis ball.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Firm granular koji is the traditional form used to make miso and is still considered the best since it has more "strength" (ability to break down proteins and carbohydrates) than the soft mat variety. High-quality granular koji will have a very small percentage of "transparent" grains (those which the mycelium has not penetrated) among the milky-white majority.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Salt</h3>
                        <p>Any salt may be used, but to make miso with the best flavor and nutritional value, use sun-dried, unrefined natural sea salt, rich in minerals (more than 63 varieties). The salt in miso mellows as the fermentation proceeds; thus miso which tastes quite salty after six months may taste just right one year later.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Water</h3>
                        <p>Any water may be used for cooking the soybeans or as mixing liquid, but fresh pure water—from a deep well, spring, or distilled—has traditionally been considered to give the best flavor and most trouble-free fermentation.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Seed Miso</h3>
                        <p>Use any good-quality mature miso, either from a previous batch of your own making or commercial miso which has not been pasteurized and contains no preservatives. The use of a small amount of seed miso as an inoculum adds large numbers of yeasts and bacteria to the unfermented ingredients, enhancing the aroma and flavor of the finished product and reducing the fermentation time by up to 50 percent.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Mixing Liquid</h3>
                        <p>Either boiled water or the cooking liquid remaining after boiling the soybeans is mixed with the other ingredients to give the miso its proper moisture content. In Japan, this is called "seed water" (tané mizu).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Alternate Ingredients</h3>
                        <p>For rice or barley koji, you may substitute up to 50 percent cornmeal or corn, sweet potatoes, Irish potatoes, or kabocha. For soybeans, you may substitute up to 100 percent broad, black, azuki, lima, or garbanzo beans, or others. If 10 to 20 percent soybeans (and peanuts) are used together with these ingredients, the amino acid balance and total usable protein will be considerably enhanced.</p>

                    <div id="miso-types" class="miso">
                        <h2>Types of Miso</h2>
                        <p>There are several varieties of miso, each with distinct characteristics:</p>
                        
                        <h3>Red Miso (Sendai Miso)</h3>
                        <p>A traditional miso with a deep, rich flavor. The basic proportions by weight are: soybeans 10, dried rice koji 8.5, salt 4.4, mixing liquid 11.1 (reduced to 6.7 if using fresh koji), seed miso 0.4. It requires at least 6 months of fermentation including 1 full summer, with the finest flavor attained after 12 months.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Barley Miso</h3>
                        <p>Made with barley koji instead of rice koji, giving it a distinct flavor profile.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Light-yellow Miso</h3>
                        <p>A milder miso with a lighter color and more delicate flavor.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Sweet Red Miso</h3>
                        <p>Contains less salt than traditional red miso, giving it a sweeter taste.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Sweet White Miso</h3>
                        <p>The sweetest and mildest variety, with the lowest salt content.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Mellow Barley Miso</h3>
                        <p>A milder version of barley miso with a more balanced flavor.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Soybean Miso</h3>
                        <p>Made primarily from soybeans with minimal or no grain koji.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="miso-preparation" class="miso">
                        <h2>Homemade Miso Preparation</h2>
                        <p>The process of making homemade miso involves several key steps:</p>
                        
                        <h3>Preparing the Soybeans</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Remove any split soybeans, then wash beans thoroughly.</li>
                            <li>Soak beans for 3 hours, or until they have swelled to fill hulls tightly.</li>
                            <li>Cook beans under pressure for 25 minutes at 15 pounds (or 30 minutes at 10 pounds, 75 minutes at 5 pounds).</li>
                            <li>Test for doneness; each bean should be soft enough to be easily crushed between your thumb and ring finger.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Preparing the Mixture</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Drain cooked beans and mash until only about one-third remain whole.</li>
                            <li>Allow beans' temperature to cool to 110°F.</li>
                            <li>Combine salt, seed miso (if used), and mixing liquid in a separate pot.</li>
                            <li>Crumble koji into the liquid mixture.</li>
                            <li>Add soybeans and mix all ingredients thoroughly.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Fermentation</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Pack the miso mixture into a clean fermentation vessel, removing air pockets.</li>
                            <li>Sprinkle salt over the surface and cover with a sealing sheet.</li>
                            <li>Add weights to press the miso.</li>
                            <li>Store in an unheated environment with no direct sunlight and adequate air circulation.</li>
                            <li>Allow to ferment for the appropriate time based on the type of miso (6-24 months).</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Monitoring and Completion</h3>
                        <p>During fermentation, check the miso occasionally but not too frequently. When mature, remove any surface mold, mix thoroughly to distribute tamari and saltier surface layer, and store in a cool place for daily use.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="variations" class="miso">
                        <h2>Variations and Techniques</h2>
                        
                        <h3>Cooking Soybeans Without Pressure</h3>
                        <p>Wash beans thoroughly, soak for 12-14 hours, then simmer for about 4-5 hours total, adding water as needed until beans are soft.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Temperature-controlled Fermentation</h3>
                        <p>For faster fermentation, place the miso in a warm environment (70-85°F) for the first few months of fermentation, following a specific temperature schedule.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Using Fresh Koji</h3>
                        <p>Fresh koji can be substituted for dried koji, using 1.14 times as much by weight and reducing the mixing liquid to 40-60% of the original amount.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Using Soy Grits</h3>
                        <p>Soy grits can reduce soaking, cooking, and fermentation times, yielding a lighter colored miso. They can be pressure cooked for just 12 minutes or boiled for 1 hour after soaking.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="salt-proportions" class="miso">
                        <h2>Salt Proportions and Fermentation</h2>
                        <p>The salt in miso serves as a preservative and flavor enhancer. Different types of miso require different salt proportions:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Red Miso: Higher salt content (4.4 pounds per 10 pounds soybeans)</li>
                            <li>Sweet White Miso: Lower salt content (2.4 pounds per 10 pounds soybeans)</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>As a general rule, the minimum amount of salt used with a given weight of grain or dried koji should follow a specific formula to prevent spoilage. People wishing to prepare low-salt misos should make either sweet red or sweet white varieties rather than simply reducing salt in other types.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div id="conclusion" class="miso">
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Miso is a versatile, nutritious fermented food with a rich history in Japanese cuisine. By understanding the basic ingredients, proportions, and fermentation process, you can create various types of miso at home, each with its own distinctive flavor profile and culinary applications. Whether you prefer the mild sweetness of white miso or the robust depth of red miso, this traditional food offers both culinary delight and nutritional benefits.</p>
                        <p>Aka miso is traditionally associated with the Tohoku region in northern Japan, where the colder climate historically required stronger preservation methods. Its intense flavor can withstand long cooking times, making it ideal for hearty winter dishes and foods that need to be preserved for extended periods.</p>

                        <h2>4. Barley Miso = 麦味噌 (Mugi Miso)</h2>
                        <p>Barley miso is made from soybeans fermented with barley instead of rice. It has a slightly sweet taste with strong barley notes. The fermentation period is typically medium-length (about 6 months), resulting in a flavor that's stronger than white miso but milder than red varieties. The color is usually light to medium brown. It's excellent in soups, sauces, and marinades.</p>
                        
                        <p>Mugi miso is particularly popular in the southern island of Kyushu. The use of barley instead of rice historically reflected the agricultural practices of different regions in Japan, where certain grains were more readily available than others. Barley miso has a distinctive aroma that adds complexity to dishes.</p>
